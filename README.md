This is an endless racing game demo based on Unity, which uses Perlin noise to automatically and randomly generate terrain, and achieves endless scrolling of the map that can be infinitely looped. The map utilizes a rotation of two cylindrical terrains, which serves as a small memory pool to save space. Particle effects and skid trails are added to the car's movement, and display optimizations are made. Animations are created for the car, and an animation state machine is used for control. The Collider and Rigidbody components are used for physical simulation. The particle system and sound system are utilized to create special effects and add sound to the game.# Endless-Racing
